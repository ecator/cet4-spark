[00:03.32]Model Test One
[00:04.52]Section A
[00:05.71]Directions: In this section,
[00:08.73]you will hear three news reports.
[00:11.90]At the end of each news report,
[00:14.43]you will hear two or three questions.
[00:17.65]Both the news report and the questions will be spoken only once.
[00:23.18]After you hear a question,
[00:25.97]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[00:29.77]marked A),B), C) and D).
[00:32.79]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[00:37.02]with a single line through the centre.
[00:39.67]Questions 1 and 2 will be based on the following news item.
[00:44.61]The shooting occurred Thursday in a lecture hall
[00:49.52]at Northern Illinois University in DeKalb,
[00:52.81]Illinois, north of Chicago.
[00:54.98]The gunman entered the hall dressed in black
[00:58.18]and carrying a shotgun and three handguns
[01:01.52]and began firing as students sought cover under desks.
[01:06.00]One student who escaped unharmed told reporters
[01:10.93]his life had changed as a result of what he experienced.
[01:15.15]Police say the gunman was Steven Kazmierczak,
[01:19.49]27, a former graduate student in Sociology at the school.
[01:25.79]Police say he purchased the shotgun
[01:29.43]and two of the handguns on Saturday,
[01:32.01]indicating he may have planned the attack in advance,
[01:36.30]but authorities have not determined a motive for the shooting.
[01:41.54]Kazmierczak had no criminal record and no history of mental illness.
[01:48.13]Under Illinois state law he would not
[01:52.10]have been able to purchase a weapon legally
[01:54.30]if there had been a record of arrests or mental problems.
[01:58.69]But police say he stopped taking an unspecified medication recently
[02:04.69]and his behavior became erratic.
[02:09.09]1. What is this news item mainly about?
[02:29.31]2. What is the reason of the shooting?
[02:48.63]Questions 3 and 4 will be based on the following news item.
[02:54.41]In recent months a string of countries,
[02:56.90]from Japan to Switzerland,
[02:58.55]Colombia to Israel,
[03:00.63]have tried to drive down the value of their currencies.
[03:04.38]Some experts call it “competitive devaluation.” Others,
[03:09.99]though, argue that it is nothing short of a currency war―
[03:14.62]and far from boosting global recovery,
[03:17.21]it threatens to undermine it.
[03:19.44]So concerned are policymakers that the issue looks set
[03:24.26]to dominate talks on Friday
[03:26.23]at a meeting of finance ministers and central bankers.
[03:30.02]Dominique Strauss-Kahn,
[03:32.70]managing director of the International Monetary Fund,
[03:36.03]which hosts the meeting in Washington,
[03:38.40]set out the concerns in the Financial Times on Tuesday.
[03:42.86]“There is clearly the idea beginning to circulate
[03:46.98]that currencies can be used as a policy weapon.
[03:50.40]Translated into action,
[03:52.69]such an idea would represent a very serious risk
[03:56.92]to the global recovery,” he said.
[03:59.11]3.What has happened to Israel’s currency?
[04:20.62]4.What can we learn from Dominique Strauss-Kahn?
[04:40.67]Questions 5 to 7 will be based on the following news item.
[04:47.18]The latest round of United Nations climate change talks
[04:50.63]begins Monday in the coastal resort city of Cancun,Mexico.
[04:55.85]Representatives from 194 countries are scheduled to attend.
[05:01.07]Negotiators will try to close the political gap
[05:05.97]between commitments to reduce carbon emissions
[05:09.15]made by developed and developing nations.
[05:12.33]Last year’s talks in Copenhagen,
[05:15.41]Denmark, carried high hopes for a binding global agreement
[05:20.19]to curb carbon emissions,
[05:22.61]but in the end delivered a disappointing and loose set of voluntary actions
[05:29.00]named the “Copenhagen Accord.”
[05:32.77]Eighty countries responsible for 80 percent
[05:35.62]of the world’s carbon emissions signed the accord,
[05:39.15]agreeing―among other things―
[05:42.08]that the global temperature rise should be limited
[05:45.68]to two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.
[05:51.61]5.What is the latest round of UN climate change talks focused on?
[06:15.14]6. How was the result of last year’s talks in Copenhagen?
[06:36.15]7.How many countries signed the “Copenhagen Accord”?
[06:57.05]Section B
[06:58.48]Directions: In this section,
[07:01.12]you will hear two long conversations.
[07:04.38]At the end of each conversation,
[07:06.45]you will hear four questions.
[07:09.43]Both the conversation and the questions will be spoken only once.
[07:14.66]After you hear a question,
[07:17.19]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[07:20.86]marked A), B), C) and D).
[07:24.50]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[07:29.29]with a single line through the centre.
[07:33.34]Conversation One
[07:34.90]M: Hi, Helen! Nice to see you again.
[07:38.01]W: Yes, it’s been a while.
[07:40.38]Hey, you’ve gotten bigger since the last time I saw you.
[07:44.29]M: Yeah, ever since I got married,
[07:47.05]I’ve been putting on weight.
[07:49.23]My wife’s a good cook.
[07:51.21]W: You need to start exercising again.
[07:54.02]Have you thought about joining a health club?
[07:56.78]M: I have. But they are expensive.
[08:00.17]And I don’t have the time.
[08:02.14]W: I’m a member at Spa Fitness
[08:04.79]and you’d be surprised at
[08:06.76]how inexpensive a year membership is.
[08:09.71]Most of the members are ordinary people
[08:12.17]who work out for about an hour just three times a week.
[08:16.17]M: Sounds reasonable.
[08:17.77]I mean, you look skinny enough.
[08:20.49]W: Well, to tell the truth,
[08:23.33]I haven’t always been this lean.
[08:24.92]After I turned 30,
[08:26.93]I started putting on the pounds.
[08:28.95]I couldn’t fit into my favorite skirts anymore
[08:32.58]and I didn’t have any energy.
[08:34.99]So I decided to do exercise.
[08:37.85]Once you start a regular exercise program,
[08:41.17]you start feeling better immediately.
[08:43.77]M: Is that right?
[08:45.23]I read that Americans are getting fatter.
[08:48.33]In fact, the average American teen is 10 to 20 pounds heavier today
[08:54.36]than in the 1980s.
[08:56.49]I’m amazed at how many fat teenage girls I see.
[09:01.25]W: That’s because of lifestyle changes.
[09:03.69]Health clubs aren’t just for beautiful people.
[09:06.05]Actually, the majority of the members are trying to lose weight like us.
[09:11.40]So will you join me for a workout?
[09:14.12]I can get you in free of charge tonight with a guest pass.
[09:17.51]M: Why not?
[09:19.39]I’ve got nothing to lose.
[09:21.36]W: Nothing but a few pounds.
[09:23.30]Questions 8 to 11 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[09:30.63]8. Why does the man put on weight?
[09:50.23]9. What can we know about Spa Fitness?
[10:10.21]10. What can we infer about the woman?
[10:30.13]11. How can the man get into the health club tonight?
[10:52.26]Conversation Two
[10:52.75]M: I need a haircut.
[10:54.67]But you look pretty busy today.
[10:57.33]Do you have an opening for me?
[10:59.49]W: Yes, we do.
[11:01.04]I can cut your hair right now if you like.
[11:03.98]Do you need a shampoo too?
[11:06.05]Or just a haircut?
[11:07.66]M: Just a haircut.
[11:09.26]I washed my hair this morning.
[11:11.20]W: Alright. I will have an assistant wet your hair.
[11:14.38]Then I can start.
[11:16.23]Please step over there.
[11:17.82]How would you like to have your hair cut today?
[11:20.83]M: Well, I had a haircut eight weeks ago.
[11:25.18]So my hair is pretty long.
[11:27.10]However, I want the same style as the last time.
[11:31.09]W: I recommend you leave it a little long on top.
[11:35.06]But we should take in the back and sides a bit more.
[11:38.36]That’s more fashionable now.
[11:40.18]M: Alright.
[11:41.48]You are the expert.
[11:43.05]I’m happy to have your recommendation.
[11:45.57]W: And do you usually part your hair along here?
[11:48.83]M: Yes.
[11:49.86]W: Alright, I know just what to do.
[11:52.63]Your hair seems quite dry,you know.
[11:55.76]And I see some split ends.
[11:57.91]M: Yes, I know my hair is quite thin.
[12:01.71]It runs in my family.
[12:03.78]Everybody has very thin hair.
[12:06.03]W: The problem is the split ends.
[12:08.51]They make your hair look frizzy.
[12:10.55]M: I don’t know what to do with it.
[12:13.01]W: Well, it’s easy.
[12:15.06]Don’t blow-dry your hair for so long after you shower.
[12:18.24]Let it dry naturally,
[12:20.18]then you won’t get split ends.
[12:22.09]M: Oh really?
[12:23.62]I will try.
[12:25.34]Thanks.
[12:27.24]Questions 12 to 15 are based on the conversation you have just heard.
[12:32.30]12. What will the woman do before cutting the man’s hair?
[12:53.78]13. What’s the problem of the man’s hair?
[13:13.74]14. What causes this hair problem?
[13:32.86]15. What does the woman suggest the man do
[13:36.80]to deal with his hair problem?
[13:54.62]Section C
[13:55.96]Directions: In this section,
[13:58.79]you will hear three passages.
[14:01.13]At the end of each passage,
[14:03.13]you will hear some questions.
[14:05.38]Both the passage and the questions will be spoken only once.
[14:10.25]After you hear a question,
[14:12.33]you must choose the best answer from the four choices
[14:16.15]marked A), B), C) and D).
[14:19.43]Then mark the corresponding letter on Answer Sheet 1
[14:23.90]with a single line through the centre.
[14:27.68]Passage One
[14:29.17]How did the first sliced bread and other famous foods get their names?
[14:36.12]It has been a mystery for a long time.
[14:39.50]Some researchers have decided to compile the answers
[14:43.57]and finally there is a surprising story behind the brand name.
[14:48.47]Consumers had long been slicing bread themselves
[14:52.55]and any store-bought bread before the late 1920s was unsliced,
[14:58.26]and people could just bite on the loaf.
[15:00.96]Even Wonder Bread wasn’t sliced at first.
[15:04.45]Created in 1921 by the Taggart Baking Company of Indianapolis,
[15:10.85]Indiana, the new bread was almost ready for market
[15:14.92]when the question of a name arose.
[15:17.51]Making a striking name for its new bread was really a tough question.
[15:22.69]Vice president Elmer Cline happened to attend a balloon race one day.
[15:28.27]The sight of dozens of brightly-colored hot-air balloons
[15:32.32]in the sky filled him with,
[15:34.72]as he later said,
[15:35.78]“wonder.” And afterwards,
[15:37.82]Wonder Bread was born. Cline, in fact,
[15:41.00]was so impressed with the sight of those balloons
[15:44.52]that he covered his new product’s wrapper with red,
[15:48.28]yellow and blue balloons,
[15:50.55]which is still Wonder’s package design today.
[15:54.29]You might think that a product combining balloons,
[15:57.72]bread and a sense of wonder wouldn’t get any better.
[16:01.60]But in 1933,
[16:04.28]Wonder introduced the very first pre-sliced loaf of bread
[16:08.51]to American consumers,
[16:10.35]the popularity of which is reflected in that phrase―
[16:13.64]“the best thing since sliced bread.”
[16:17.32]Questions 16 to 18 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[16:23.26]16. What can we learn about the bread before the late 1920s?
[16:46.34]17. Where did Wonder Bread get its name?
[17:06.45]18. What does the package design of Wonder Bread look like today?
[17:28.07]Passage Two
[17:29.66]In 1967, American Vogue magazine published an article
[17:33.86]called “Can Great Skin Be Created?”
[17:37.22]written by Beauty editor Carol Phillips with Dr.Norman Orentreich,
[17:43.50]discussing the significance of a skin care routine.
[17:47.26]Evelyn Lauder, daughter-in-law of Estée Lauder,
[17:51.31]read the article and brought it to Estée’s attention.
[17:55.09]Both Carol Phillips and Dr. Orentreich were recruited
[17:59.98]to help create the brand,and in August,1968,
[18:04.53]Clinique emerged as the world’s first hypo-allergenic,
[18:09.18]skin care line at Saks Fifth Avenue.
[18:12.72]Clinique tests its product for allergic reactions
[18:15.98]by applying it to 600 people 12 times,
[18:19.99]with a standard of zero reactions.
[18:23.33]There are three formulas available
[18:25.67]in North America and Europe―extra-mild,mild, and oily.
[18:31.06]Clinique also has a facial care line called CX
[18:35.47]which contains products targeted on specialized needs,
[18:39.29]such as stretch marks associated with pregnancy.
[18:42.72]Clinique also carries a skin care line targeted on men.
[18:47.43]Although mostly known as a skin care line,
[18:51.23]52% of revenue for Clinique is derived from their makeup,
[18:55.97]25% from foundation alone.
[18:59.38]Clinique also carries a line of makeup brushes
[19:03.14]coated with an antibacterial solution.
[19:05.82]Happy, Clinique’s best-selling women’s fragrance,
[19:09.73]was introduced in 1997.
[19:12.46]It features a mixture of ruby red grapefruit,
[19:17.29]bergamot, Hawaiian wedding flower,
[19:20.51]and spring mimosa.
[19:22.66]Recently, Clinique announced a partnership with Allergan,
[19:26.63]the maker of Botox and former partner of Elizabeth Arden,
[19:31.83]with the result being a new line called Clinique Medical.
[19:36.35]The line is only available in physician’s offices.
[19:40.08]The five-product set is designed
[19:43.07]for pre- and post-operation skin care,
[19:45.69]and targets on complications such as redness,
[19:49.52]tightness, burning, irritation and discoloration.
[19:54.31]Questions 19 to 21 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[20:01.53]19. What is Clinique?
[20:21.37]20. What do we know about the revenue for Clinique?
[20:41.53]21. What can we learn about Clinique Medical line?
[21:02.01]Passage Three
[21:03.40]As we all know,
[21:04.56]there are many differences lying between high school and college.
[21:08.87]For some students,
[21:10.08]one of the biggest differences is the amount and depth of research
[21:15.35]that is required for research papers.
[21:17.62]College professors expect students to be quite adept at researching,
[21:23.32]and for some students,
[21:24.44]this is a big change from high school.
[21:27.95]This is not to say that high school teachers don’t do a great job
[21:32.21]to prepare their students for college level research―
[21:35.45]quite the contrary!
[21:36.86]Teachers in high school play a tough and essential role
[21:40.63]in teaching students how to research and write,
[21:44.36]and college professors simply require students
[21:48.12]to take that skill to a new level.
[21:50.97]For example, you may soon discover
[21:53.72]that many college professors won’t
[21:56.36]accept encyclopedia(百科全书) articles as research sources.
[22:00.00]Encyclopedias are great for finding a compact,
[22:04.49]informative accumulation of research on a specific topic.
[22:08.16]They are a great resource for finding the basic facts,
[22:12.60]but they are limited when it comes to
[22:15.19]offering interpretations of the facts.
[22:18.76]Professors require students to dig a little deeper than that,
[22:23.20]accumulate their own evidence from broader sources,
[22:26.81]and form opinions about their sources as well as the specific topics.
[22:31.80]For this reason,
[22:32.79]college-bound students should become familiar with the library
[22:37.75]and all its terms,rules and methods.
[22:40.74]They should also have the confidence
[22:43.02]to venture outside the comfort of the local public library
[22:47.15]and explore more diverse resources.
[22:49.34]Questions 22 to 25 are based on the passage you have just heard.
[22:57.04]22. What is the big change
[23:00.54]from high school to college for some students?
[23:19.44]23. What do high school teachers usually do according to the passage?
[23:40.70]24. Why shouldn’t encyclopedias be used as research sources?
[24:02.37]25. What do professors ask students to do when doing research?
[24:24.67]This is the end of listening comprehension.
